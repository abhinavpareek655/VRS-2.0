# Vehicle Booking Flow Progress

## Current State (as of July 2025)

### Implemented
- **Search vehicles:** Users can search by location and date using the Booking Widget.
- **List/filter vehicles:** Vehicles are listed and can be filtered/sorted on `/vehicles`.

### Not Yet Implemented
- **Vehicle details page:** No `/vehicles/[id]` page exists yet.
- **Booking form (per vehicle):** No form to book a specific vehicle.
- **Booking submission:** No logic to create a booking in the database.
- **Booking confirmation:** No confirmation page/modal after booking.
- **User booking management:** No dashboard for users to view/cancel bookings.
- **Payment integration:** No payment step or status tracking.

## Next Steps
1. **Implement vehicle details and booking page** (`/vehicles/[id]`)
2. Booking form and submission logic
3. Booking confirmation UI
4. User booking management dashboard
5. Payment integration

## Decisions & Notes
- Booking widget passes search params to `/vehicles`.
- Vehicles are fetched from Supabase and filtered client-side.
- Booking table and logic exist in the database, but not yet in the UI.

## [Update: July 2025]

### Progress Made
- **Vehicle details and booking page implemented** (`/vehicles/[id]`):
  - Fetches and displays vehicle details (image, name, brand, model, year, price, features, etc.)
  - Simple, user-friendly booking form (pickup location, pickup/return date & time, special requests)
  - Pre-fills form fields from search parameters if available
  - Validates required fields and provides feedback
  - Submits booking to Supabase and shows confirmation
  - Redirects to dashboard after successful booking
  - UI aligned with current website style
- **Minor UI refinement:** Card padding adjusted for better spacing

### Next Planned Feature
- Integrate a map on the booking page to display the pickup location and set the user's current location as default (if permitted).
